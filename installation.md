# Installation

This document provides detailed steps for installing the NFS (Network File System) server on a Linux system(Ubuntu). Follow these instructions to set up your NFS server and enable file sharing across your network Linux OS.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following requirement:

- A Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu) with administrative privileges.
- Access to the internet to download necessary packages.

## Step 1: Update System Packages (apt update)

Open a terminal on your Linux system and run the following commands to update the system's package list and upgrade installed packages:



```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y   



# -y in front of the command is for acceptance of the further dependences reqired for the package "apt upgrade" so it will not slow down the process and it a good practice for installing packages in Linux.
